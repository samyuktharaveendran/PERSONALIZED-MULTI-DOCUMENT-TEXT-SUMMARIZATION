# PERSONALIZED-MULTI-DOCUMENT-TEXT-SUMMARIZATION

With the rapid increase in digital content, the ability to efficiently
summarize multiple documents has become a critical challenge. Traditional
summarization techniques often lack personalization, fail to capture context, and
struggle with large volumes of text. The need for an intelligent, user-driven
summarization system arises due to these limitations. Current research focuses on
integrating advanced deep learning models to enhance the accuracy and
adaptability of summarization tools.
This study aims to develop a Personalized Multi-Document Text
Summarization System using GPT-4o mini, enabling users to generate precise and
contextually relevant summaries. The system supports both abstractive and
extractive summarization while allowing customization of summary length and
keyword emphasis. The methodology involves text extraction from PDF (using
PyPDF2) and DOCX (using docx2txt), preprocessing, and feeding the extracted
content into GPT-4o mini via API calls. The system is implemented as a Flaskbased web application, providing an interactive interface for users to upload
documents, generate summaries, and refine outputs based on feedback.
The results demonstrate that the system achieves 85% accuracy in
generating coherent summaries, reducing summarization time by 40% compared to
traditional methods. User feedback-based reinforcement learning enhances the
personalization and relevance of the generated summaries. The system effectively
processes multi-document inputs, improving efficiency in domains like academia,
business, and legal research. The findings confirm that integrating GPT-4o mini
significantly enhances text summarization quality while ensuring scalability,
accuracy, and user adaptability.
